# StepSync: Visualize and Improve Your Walking Posture
## Overview
StepSync is a real-time posture and gait analysis tool that helps users evaluate and improve how they walk. Built with computer vision, 3D modeling, and biomechanical data, our interactive visualization allows users to compare their movements with a healthy walking reference model—anytime, anywhere.

## Motivation
Studies show that Gen Z exhibits some of the poorest posture and walking habits, which can lead to long-term health issues. StepSync offers a practical solution: visualize your gait, identify poor walking mechanics, and take actionable steps to improve your posture in real-time.

## What It Does
StepSync uses 3D coordinate data collected from 14 healthy individuals to create an interactive walking reference. Here's how it works:

- User Matching: Based on gender and BMI, the tool selects the closest matching subject in our dataset.

- 3D Visualization: Users can view and explore aspects like foot placement, knee and hip alignment, core stability, and upper-body movement.

- Live Comparison: With MediaPipe and OpenCV, we track the user’s gait in real-time and highlight key joints to help compare against the ideal model.

- Instant Feedback: Users can see where their movement deviates and adjust accordingly.

## Why It Matters
Most people aren’t aware of how much their posture during walking impacts their health. StepSync makes these invisible patterns visible—and correctable. Whether you're recovering from an injury, training as an athlete, or just looking to move better, StepSync gives you the tools to take the next step in the right direction.
